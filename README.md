## Welcome!

This is my website (powered by Github Pages™ (powered by Jekyll™ (powered by Ruby™ (oh no...)))).

### So, what is this website for?

One day it will be my résumé alas that day is not upon us - woe is you, oh weary internet traveller.

Or rather, it will be a place for me to dump links to the project(s) which shall comprise my "living résumé".

For now, you can find a bit of info. [here](https://thepond.xyz) instead.

### Just a résumé?

Well, maybe I'll write a little about myself and stuff. I suppose that would make sense, wouldn't it?

### Anything else?

Can't you just be content with a résumé? Geez.

Additionally, then, I imagine I'll link to various social media accounts.

After all that seems to be a pretty personal website-y thing to do?

### I desire more...

There's no pleasing you.

Okay, fine. I'll also probably maybe possibly conceivably perhaps write about stuff too on occasions never always sometimes.

## Yeah, I have no idea...

If anyone is willing to teach me how to present myself more professionally, feel free to [not IM me](mailto:sustained@thepond.xyz).
